# Connect the Pages
Take the starter code and create a link between the index and about pages. As well as making a link to a website that you think has a good layout.

**Your final solution should have the following**
1. When Home is clicked the browser should go to the index.html
2. When About is clicked the browser should go to the about.html
3. When name of your selected website is clicked the brouser should go to that website.
4. Add something to the About page to let us know we are on the about page.
5. Add something to the Home page to let us know we are on the home page.
